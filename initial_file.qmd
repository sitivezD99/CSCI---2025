Today we are going to analize data on flights from New York City!!! Lets first load some packages. we are going to read the following packages.

- `tidyverse`: This includes all the functions for manipulating and plotting our data.
- `nycflights13`:  This includes the dataset we are workling with.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```
Now that we have loaded our datasets, lets create some exploratory plots. The plot shows un that [come back -- B6] is the bost comon airline to leave out of JFK.

```{r}
flights |>
    filter(origin == "JFK") |>
    ggplot(aes(x = carrier)) + 
    geom_bar()
```

```{r}
top_airline <- flights |>
    count(carrier) |>
    slice_max(n, n = 1)
```
